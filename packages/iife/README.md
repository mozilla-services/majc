# Mozilla Ads JavaScript Client: IIFE

This sub-package contains a thin wrapper around the core functionality and exports a single global `mozAds` object with a `renderPlacement` function and constants from the `core` sub-package suitable for bundling as an [IIFE](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/IIFE) for inclusion in a webpage using a `<script>` tag.

Please refer to `README.md` in the root of the MAJC repo for instructions on building and testing.
