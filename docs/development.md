# Development

After cloning this repo, install all dependencies and build:

```sh
npm install
npm run build
```

## Repo structure

All MAJC source code is housed under the `packages` directory:

- `./core`
  - Contains all core shared functionality used to build the other framework-specific sub-packages
- `./heyapi`
  - Auto-generated code containing a fetch client and all of the data structures for the MARS APIs defined in `./heyapi/mars.yml`
- `./iife`
  - A lightweight IIFE wrapper around the `core` sub-package exposed as a `renderPlacement` function
- `./react`
  - A React-specific wrapper around the `core` sub-package containing a `MozAdsPlacement` component as well as related hooks
- `./examples`
  - Examples of different kinds of apps using MAJC


## Linting

This repository is linted using `eslint`. To run the linter:

```sh
npm run lint
```

Or, to fix issues that can be automatically resolved:

```sh
npm run lint:fix
```

## Pre-commit hooks

Husky manages all pre-commits via the `.husky/pre-commit` file. Currently, the only pre-commit hook runs `npm run build` and adds any changes in `./dist` to the commit.

### Disabling hooks locally

If you want to disable pre-commit hooks locally for any reason, set the `HUSKY=0` environment variable or preface `git commit`:

```sh
HUSKY=0 git commit -m "Your commit message"
```

## Example apps

- IIFE
  - `npm run example:iife`
- React
  - `npm run example:react`

NOTE: When testing local changes, be sure to re-build via `npm run build` to ensure the example apps are referencing the latest changes.

## Updating MARS API definitions

All of the code in the `packages/heyapi` sub-package is auto-generated by the API definitions in [`openapi.yml`](https://github.com/mozilla-services/mars/blob/main/openapi/openapi.yml) from the [mozilla-services/mars](https://github.com/mozilla-services/mars) repo. To pull in the latest version of the API definitions and re-generate an updated fetch client and data structures:

```sh
npm run update:mars-api
```

Note: This will only be possible for internal Mozillians who have access to the MARS repo.

## End-to-end testing with Playwright

We use [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) for end-to-end/view testing. It loads up our example
apps and make sure they work correctly cross-browser and cross-device from a user-facing perspective.

To run the tests on the command line:

```sh
npm run playwright
```

This will start up the example apps if they aren't already running, run through the tests in a headless
browser, and open an interactive html report in your browser when its finished.

Some very useful additional modes:

```sh
# Record traces. Click a test case in the HTML report to see a detailed trace, with playback timeline and UI screenshots.
npm run playwright -- --trace on
# Run tests in Playwright's UI, with test controls, locator picker, watch mode, and more.
npm run playwright -- --ui
# Run the tests with an actual browser so you can watch Playwright interact with the page.
npm run playwright -- --headed
# Run the tests with specific browsers.
npm run playwright -- --project webkit --project firefox
# Run specific tests by filename, directory, filename keywords, or title.
npm run playwright -- iife.spec.ts
npm run playwright -- tests/subdirectory/
npm run playwright -- react angular
npm run playwright -- -g 'should display the ad'
```
